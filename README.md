Augmented Reality Application (AR Garden Simulator)

This is a simple AR application. It's working with 'stones' image target. It shows a house and it's garden. 

-When you touch the man, he will say hello to you.
-When you touch the home, the garden gate will be open with 10 degrees. After the gate is opened, touching the home will close the garden gate with 10 degrees.
-There is a pink panter movie in the house and there is a picture of the family in the house.
-When you press the virtual button(on the image target) with your hand the wind will come out.
-When you press the button on the top left the lights will turn off and on.
-There is a sculpture rotating around itself in the garden.
-There is an animated butterfly flying in the garden.
